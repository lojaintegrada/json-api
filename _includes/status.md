  On the different version pages, make the status message dynamic in
  the same way the title is.

  The first paragraph in each case below aims to explain what content
  the page holds and whether that content is finalized.

  Note: all the text below must be outdented and markdownified where it's
  included for it to be rendered correctly as markdown.
{% endcomment %}

{% if is_latest_version_page %}
  This page presents the latest published version of LI:API, which is
  currently version {{ site.latest_version }}. New versions of LI:API **will
  always be backwards compatible** using a _never remove, only add_ strategy.

{% elsif version and version > site.latest_version %}
  This page will always present the most recent text for LI:API v{{ site.latest_version|plus:0.1 }}.
  Version {{ site.latest_version|plus:0.1 }} is a **{% if status == "rc" %}release 
  candidate{% else %}working draft{% endif %}**. As such, the content on this 
  page {% if status != "rc" %}is subject to change.{% else %}is unlikely to 
  change. However, some changes may still occur if implementation experience 
  proves that they are necessary before this version is finalized.{% endif %}

  {% if include.release_date %}
  This version is expected to be finalized and released on **{{ include.release_date | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}** 
  (provided there are two compliant implementations by that date; if not the 
  release will wait until such implementations exist to prove its viability).
  {% endif %}

{% elsif version and version == site.latest_version %}
  This page presents an archived copy of LI:API version {{ version }}. None
  of the normative text on this page will change. **Subsequent versions of
  LI:API will remain compatible with this one**, as LI:API uses a _never
  remove, only add_ strategy.

{% else %}
  This page presents an archived copy of LI:API version {{ version }}. None
  of the normative text on this page will change. While {{ version }} is no
  longer the [latest version](/format/) of LI:API, **new versions will remain
  compatible with this one**, as LI:API uses a _never remove, only add_ strategy.
{% endif %}

{% comment %}
  Now, add a second (and sometimes third) paragraph for the different cases,
  indicating the type of feedback we want (user/implementor concerns, error
  reports, proposed additions, etc) for that case and the best way to submit it.
