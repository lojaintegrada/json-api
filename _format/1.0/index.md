## <a href="#introduction" id="introduction" class="headerlink"></a> Introduction

LI:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be
fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

LI:API requires use of the LI:API media type
([`application/json`](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/json))
for exchanging data.

## <a href="#semantics" id="semantics" class="headerlink"></a> Semantics

All document members, query parameters, and processing rules defined by
this specification are collectively called "specification semantics".

Certain document members, query parameters, and processing rules are reserved
for implementors to define at their discretion. These are called "implementation
semantics".

All other semantics are reserved for potential future use by this specification.

## <a href="#conventions" id="conventions" class="headerlink"></a> Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
[BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14)
[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)]
[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## <a href="#jsonapi-media-type" id="jsonapi-media-type" class="headerlink"></a> The LI:API Media Type

The LI:API media type is
[`application/json`](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/json).

## <a href="#content-negotiation" id="content-negotiation" class="headerlink"></a> Content Negotiation

### <a href="#content-negotiation-all" id="content-negotiation-all" class="headerlink"></a> Universal Responsibilities

Clients and servers **MUST** send all LI:API payloads using the LI:API media
type in the `Content-Type` header.

### <a href="#content-negotiation-clients" id="content-negotiation-clients" class="headerlink"></a> Client Responsibilities

When processing a LI:API response document, clients **MUST** ignore any
parameters in the server's `Content-Type` header.

### <a href="#content-negotiation-servers" id="content-negotiation-servers" class="headerlink"></a> Server Responsibilities

Servers **MUST** send all LO:API data in response documents with the header `Content-Type: application/json` without any media type parameters.

Servers **MUST** respond with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` status code if a request specifies the header `Content-Type: application/json` with any media type parameters.

Servers **MUST** respond with a `406 Not Acceptable status` code if a requestâ€™s Accept header contains the LI:API media type and all instances of that media type are modified with media type parameters.

## <a href="#document-structure" id="document-structure" class="headerlink"></a> Document Structure

This section describes the structure of a LI:API document, which is identified
by the [LI:API media type](#content-negotiation-all). LI:API documents are
defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259)].

Although the same media type is used for both request and response documents,
certain aspects are only applicable to one or the other. These differences are
called out below.

Unless otherwise noted, objects defined by this specification **MUST NOT** contain any
additional members. Client and server implementations **MUST** ignore non-compliant members.

> Note: These conditions allow this specification to evolve through additive
changes.

### <a href="#document-top-level" id="document-top-level" class="headerlink"></a> Top Level

A JSON object **MUST** be at the root of every LI:API request and response
document containing data. This object defines a document's "top level".

A document **MUST** contain at least one of the following top-level members:

* `data`: the document's "primary data"
* `errors`: an array of [error objects](#errors)
* `meta`: a [meta object][meta] that contains non-standard
  meta-information.

The members `data` and `errors` **MUST NOT** coexist in the same document.

A document **MAY** contain any of these top-level members:

* `links`: a [links object][links] related to the primary data.

The top-level [links object][links] **MAY** contain the following members:

* [pagination] links for the primary data.

The document's "primary data" is a representation of the resource or collection
of resources targeted by a request.

Primary data **MUST** be either:

* a single [resource object][resource objects], a single [resource identifier object], or `null`,
  for requests that target single resources
* an array of [resource objects], an array of
  [resource identifier objects][resource identifier object], or
  an empty array (`[]`), for requests that target resource collections

For example, the following primary data is a single resource object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "full name",
    "author": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "author name"
    }
  }
}
```

The following primary data is a single [resource identifier object] that
references the same resource:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1"
  }
}
```

A logical collection of resources **MUST** be represented as an array, even if
it only contains one item or is empty.

### <a href="#document-resource-objects" id="document-resource-objects" class="headerlink"></a> Resource Objects

"Resource objects" appear in a LI:API document to represent resources.

A resource object **MUST** contain at least the following top-level members:

* `id`

Exception: The `id` member is not required when the resource object originates
at the client and represents a new resource to be created on the server.

Here's how an article (i.e. a resource of type "articles") might appear in a document:

```json
// ...
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Rails is Omakase",
  "author": {
    "id": "9"
  }
}
// ...
```

##### <a href="#document-resource-object-relationships" id="document-resource-object-relationships" class="headerlink"></a> Relationships

TO DO

A "resource identifier object" is an object that identifies an individual
resource.

A "resource identifier object" **MUST** contain an `id` member, except when it 
represents a new resource to be created on the server.

The values of the `id` **MUST** be strings.

### <a href="#document-member-names" id="document-member-names" class="headerlink"></a> Member Names

Defined member names used in a LI:API document **MUST** be treated as case sensitive
by clients and servers, and they **MUST** meet all of the following conditions:

- Member names **MUST** contain at least one character.
- Member names **MUST** contain only the allowed characters listed below.
- Member names **MUST** start and end with a "globally allowed character",
  as defined below.

To enable an easy mapping of member names to URLs, it is **RECOMMENDED** that
member names use only non-reserved, URL safe characters specified in [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-13).

#### <a href="#document-member-names-allowed-characters" id="document-member-names-allowed-characters" class="headerlink"></a> Allowed Characters

The following "globally allowed characters" **MAY** be used anywhere in a member name:

- U+0061 to U+007A, "a-z"
- U+0030 to U+0039, "0-9"

Additionally, the following characters are allowed in member names, except as the
first or last character:

- U+005F UNDERLINE, "_"

## <a href="#fetching" id="fetching" class="headerlink"></a> Fetching Data

Data, including resources and relationships, can be fetched by sending a
`GET` request to an endpoint.

Responses can be further refined with the optional features described below.

### <a href="#fetching-resources" id="fetching-resources" class="headerlink"></a> Fetching Resources

For example, the following request fetches a collection of articles:

```http
GET /articles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

The following request fetches an article:

```http
GET /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

And the following request fetches an article's author:

```http
GET /articles/1/author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

#### <a href="#fetching-resources-responses" id="fetching-resources-responses" class="headerlink"></a> Responses

##### <a href="#fetching-resources-responses-200" id="fetching-resources-responses-200" class="headerlink"></a> 200 OK

A server **MUST** respond to a successful request to fetch an individual
resource or resource collection with a `200 OK` response.

A server **MUST** respond to a successful request to fetch a resource
collection with an array of [resource objects] or an empty array (`[]`) as
the response document's primary data.

For example, a `GET` request to a collection of articles could return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "title": "LI:API paints my bikeshed!"
  }, {
    "id": "2",
    "title": "Rails is Omakase"
  }]
}
```

A similar response representing an empty collection would be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": []
}
```

A server **MUST** respond to a successful request to fetch an individual
resource with a [resource object][resource objects] or `null` provided as
the response document's primary data.

`null` is only an appropriate response when the requested URL is one that
might correspond to a single resource, but doesn't currently.

> Note: Consider, for example, a request to fetch a to-one related resource link.
This request would respond with `null` when the relationship is empty (such that
the link is corresponding to no resources) but with the single related resource's
[resource object][resource objects] otherwise.

For example, a `GET` request to an individual article could return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "title": "LI:API paints my bikeshed!",
    "author": {
      "id": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

If the above article's author is missing, then a `GET` request to that related
resource would return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": null
}
```

##### <a href="#fetching-resources-responses-404" id="fetching-resources-responses-404" class="headerlink"></a> 404 Not Found

A server **MUST** respond with `404 Not Found` when processing a request to
fetch a single resource that does not exist, except when the request warrants a
`200 OK` response with `null` as the primary data (as described above).

##### <a href="#fetching-resources-responses-other" id="fetching-resources-responses-other" class="headerlink"></a> Other Responses

A server **MAY** respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server **MAY** include [error details] with error responses.

A server **MUST** prepare responses, and a client **MUST** interpret
responses, in accordance with
[`HTTP semantics`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### <a href="#fetching-relationships" id="fetching-relationships" class="headerlink"></a> Fetching Relationships

TO DO: criar warning sobre hÃ­fen em entidades na URI.

For example, the following request fetches data about an article's comments:

```http
GET /articles/1/relationships/comments HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

And the following request fetches data about an article's author:

```http
GET /articles/1/relationships/author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

#### <a href="#fetching-relationships-responses" id="fetching-relationships-responses" class="headerlink"></a> Responses

##### <a href="#fetching-relationships-responses-200" id="fetching-relationships-responses-200" class="headerlink"></a> 200 OK

A server **MUST** respond to a successful request to fetch a relationship
with a `200 OK` response.

For example, a `GET` request to a URL from a to-one relationship link could
return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "12"
  }
}
```

If the above relationship is empty, then a `GET` request to the same URL would
return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": null
}
```

A `GET` request to a URL from a to-many relationship link could return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": [
    { "id": "2" },
    { "id": "3" }
  ]
}
```

If the above relationship is empty, then a `GET` request to the same URL would
return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": []
}
```

##### <a href="#fetching-relationships-responses-404" id="fetching-relationships-responses-404" class="headerlink"></a> 404 Not Found

A server **MUST** return `404 Not Found` when processing a request to fetch
a relationship link URL that does not exist.

> Note: This can happen when the parent resource of the relationship
does not exist. For example, when `/articles/1` does not exist, request to
`/articles/1/tags` returns `404 Not Found`.

If a relationship link URL exists but the relationship is empty, then
`200 OK` **MUST** be returned, as described above.

##### <a href="#fetching-relationships-responses-other" id="fetching-relationships-responses-other" class="headerlink"></a> Other Responses

A server **MAY** respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server **MAY** include [error details] with error responses.

A server **MUST** prepare responses, and a client **MUST** interpret
responses, in accordance with
[`HTTP semantics`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### <a href="#fetching-sorting" id="fetching-sorting" class="headerlink"></a> Sorting

A server **MAY** choose to support requests to sort resource collections
according to one or more criteria ("sort fields").

> Note: Although recommended, sort fields do not necessarily need to
correspond to resource attribute and relationship names.

> Note: It is recommended that dot-separated (U+002E FULL-STOP, ".") sort
fields be used to request sorting based upon relationship attributes. For
example, a sort field of `author.name` could be used to request that the
primary data be sorted based upon the `name` attribute of the `author`
relationship.

An endpoint **MAY** support requests to sort the primary data with a `sort`
query parameter. The value for `sort` **MUST** represent sort fields.

```http
GET /people?sort=age HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

An endpoint **MAY** support multiple sort fields by allowing comma-separated
(U+002C COMMA, ",") sort fields. Sort fields **SHOULD** be applied in the
order specified.

```http
GET /people?sort=age,name HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

The sort order for each sort field **MUST** be ascending unless it is prefixed
with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, "-"), in which case it **MUST** be descending.

```http
GET /articles?sort=-created,title HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

The above example should return the newest articles first. Any articles
created on the same date will then be sorted by their title in ascending
alphabetical order.

If the server does not support sorting as specified in the query parameter
`sort`, it **MUST** return `400 Bad Request`.

If sorting is supported by the server and requested by the client via query
parameter `sort`, the server **MUST** return elements of the top-level
`data` array of the response ordered according to the criteria specified.
The server **MAY** apply default sorting rules to top-level `data` if
request parameter `sort` is not specified.

> Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with a resource
collection as primary data, regardless of the request type.

TO DO: Paramos aqui

### <a href="#fetching-pagination" id="fetching-pagination" class="headerlink"></a> Pagination

TO DO: Mover seÃ§Ã£o de exemplos de paginaÃ§Ã£o para a especificaÃ§Ã£o e ampliar.

A server **MAY** choose to limit the number of resources returned in a response
to a subset ("page") of the whole set available.

A server **MAY** provide links to traverse a paginated data set ("pagination
links").

Pagination links **MUST** appear in the links object that corresponds to a
collection. To paginate the primary data, supply pagination links in the
top-level `links` object. To paginate an included collection returned in
a [compound document], supply pagination links in the corresponding links
object.

The following keys **MUST** be used for pagination links:

* `first`: the first page of data
* `last`: the last page of data
* `prev`: the previous page of data
* `next`: the next page of data

Keys **MUST** be omitted to indicate that a
particular link is unavailable.

Concepts of order, as expressed in the naming of pagination links, **MUST**
remain consistent with LI:API's [sorting rules](#fetching-sorting).

The `page` [query parameter family] is reserved for pagination. Servers and
clients **SHOULD** use these parameters for pagination operations.

> Note: LI API is agnostic about the pagination strategy used by a server, but
> the `page` query parameter family can be used regardless of the strategy
> employed. For example, a page-based strategy might use query parameters such
> as `page[number]` and `page[size]`, while a cursor-based strategy might use
> `page[cursor]`.

> Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with a resource
collection as primary data, regardless of the request type.

### <a href="#fetching-filtering" id="fetching-filtering" class="headerlink"></a> Filtering

TO DO: Mover seÃ§Ã£o de recomendaÃ§Ãµes de filtro para a especificaÃ§Ã£o e ampliar.

The `filter` [query parameter family] is reserved for filtering data. Servers
and clients **SHOULD** use these parameters for filtering operations.

> Note: LI API is agnostic about the strategies supported by a server.

## <a href="#crud" id="crud" class="headerlink"></a> Creating, Updating and Deleting Resources

A server **MAY** allow resources of a given type to be created. It **MAY**
also allow existing resources to be modified or deleted.

A request **MUST** completely succeed or fail (in a single "transaction"). No
partial updates are allowed.

> Note: The `type` member is required in every [resource object][resource objects] throughout requests and
responses in LI:API. There are some cases, such as when `POST`ing to an
endpoint representing heterogeneous data, when the `type` could not be inferred
from the endpoint. However, picking and choosing when it is required would be
confusing; it would be hard to remember when it was required and when it was
not. Therefore, to improve consistency and minimize confusion, `type` is
always required.

### <a href="#crud-creating" id="crud-creating" class="headerlink"></a> Creating Resources

A resource can be created by sending a `POST` request to a URL that represents
a collection of resources. The request **MUST** include a single [resource object][resource objects]
as primary data.

For instance, a new photo might be created with the following request:

```http
POST /photos HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "title": "Ember Hamster",
    "src": "http://example.com/images/productivity.png",
    "photographer": {
      "id": "9"
    }
  }
}
```

#### <a href="#crud-creating-responses" id="crud-creating-responses" class="headerlink"></a> Responses

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-201" id="crud-creating-responses-201" class="headerlink"></a> 201 Created

If the requested resource has been created
successfully, the server **MUST** return a `201 Created` status code.

The response **MUST** also include a document that contains the primary
resource created.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "title": "Ember Hamster",
    "src": "http://example.com/images/productivity.png"
  }
}
```

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-202" id="crud-creating-responses-202" class="headerlink"></a> 202 Accepted

If a request to create a resource has been accepted for processing, but the
processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the
server **MUST** return a `202 Accepted` status code.

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-204" id="crud-creating-responses-204" class="headerlink"></a> 204 No Content

If the requested resource has been created
successfully, the server **MUST** return either a `201 Created` status code
and response document (as described above) or a `204 No Content` status code
with no response document.

> Note: If a `204` response is received the client should consider the resource
object sent in the request to be accepted by the server, as if the server
had returned it back in a `201` response.

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-403" id="crud-creating-responses-403" class="headerlink"></a> 403 Forbidden

A server **MAY** return `403 Forbidden` in response to an unsupported request
to create a resource.

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-404" id="crud-creating-responses-404" class="headerlink"></a> 404 Not Found

A server **MUST** return `404 Not Found` when processing a request that
references a related resource that does not exist.

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-409" id="crud-creating-responses-409" class="headerlink"></a> 409 Conflict

A server **MUST** return `409 Conflict` when processing a `POST` request to
create a resource with a unique value field that already exists.

A server **MUST** include error details and provide enough information to
recognize the source of the conflict.

##### <a href="#crud-creating-responses-other" id="crud-creating-responses-other" class="headerlink"></a> Other Responses

A server **MAY** respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server **MUST** include [error details] with error responses.

A server **MUST** prepare responses, and a client **MUST** interpret
responses, in accordance with
[`HTTP semantics`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### <a href="#crud-updating" id="crud-updating" class="headerlink"></a> Updating Resources

A resource can be updated by sending a `PATCH` request to the URL that
represents the resource.

The `PATCH` request **MUST** include a single [resource object][resource objects] as primary data.
The [resource object][resource objects] **MUST** contain `id` member.

For example:

```http
PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "title": "To TDD or Not"
  }
}
```

#### <a href="#crud-updating-resource-attributes" id="crud-updating-resource-attributes" class="headerlink"></a> Updating a Resource's Attributes

Any or all of a resource's [attributes] **MAY** be included in the resource
object included in a `PATCH` request.

If a request does not include all of the [attributes] for a resource, the server
**MUST** interpret the missing [attributes] as if they were included with their
current values. The server **MUST NOT** interpret missing attributes as `null`
values.

For example, the following `PATCH` request is interpreted as a request to
update only the `title` and `text` attributes of an article:

```http
PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "title": "To TDD or Not",
    "text": "TLDR; It's complicated... but check your test coverage regardless."
  }
}
```

#### <a href="#crud-updating-resource-relationships" id="crud-updating-resource-relationships" class="headerlink"></a> Updating a Resource's Relationships

Any or all of a resource's [relationships] **MAY** be included in the resource
object included in a `PATCH` request.

If a request does not include all of the [relationships] for a resource, the server
**MUST** interpret the missing [relationships] as if they were included with their
current values. It **MUST NOT** interpret them as `null` or empty values.

If a relationship is provided in a resource
object in a `PATCH` request, its value **MUST** be a relationship object
with a `id` member. The relationship's value will be replaced with the
value specified in this member.

For instance, the following `PATCH` request will update the `author` relationship of an article:

```http
PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "author": {
      "id": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

Likewise, the following `PATCH` request performs a complete replacement of
the `tags` for an article:

```http
PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "tags": [
      { "id": "2" },
      { "id": "3" }
    ]
  }
}
```

And the following request clears every tag for an article:

```http
PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "tags": []
  }
}
```

A server **MAY** reject an attempt to do a full replacement of a to-many
relationship. In such a case, the server **MUST** reject the entire update,
and return a `403 Forbidden` response.

> Note: Since full replacement may be a very dangerous operation, a server
may choose to disallow it. For example, a server may reject full replacement if
it has not provided the client with the full list of associated objects, and
does not want to allow deletion of records the client has not seen.

#### <a href="#crud-updating-responses" id="crud-updating-responses" class="headerlink"></a> Responses

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-202" id="crud-updating-responses-202" class="headerlink"></a> 202 Accepted

If an update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing
has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server **MUST**
return a `202 Accepted` status code.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-200" id="crud-updating-responses-200" class="headerlink"></a> 200 OK

If a server accepts an update but also changes the resource(s) in ways other
than those specified by the request (for example, updating the `updated-at`
attribute or a computed `sha`), it **MUST** return a `200 OK` response. The
response document **MUST** include a representation of the updated
resource(s) as if a `GET` request was made to the request URL.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-204" id="crud-updating-responses-204" class="headerlink"></a> 204 No Content

If an update is successful and the server doesn't update any fields besides
those provided, the server **MUST** return either a `200 OK` status code and
response document (as described above) or a `204 No Content` status code with no
response document.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-relationship-responses-403" id="crud-updating-relationship-responses-403" class="headerlink"></a> 403 Forbidden

A server **MUST** return `403 Forbidden` in response to an unsupported request
to update a resource or relationship.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-404" id="crud-updating-responses-404" class="headerlink"></a> 404 Not Found

A server **MUST** return `404 Not Found` when processing a request to modify
a resource that does not exist.

A server **MUST** return `404 Not Found` when processing a request that
references a related resource that does not exist.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-409" id="crud-updating-responses-409" class="headerlink"></a> 409 Conflict

A server **MAY** return `409 Conflict` when processing a `PATCH` request to
update a resource if that update would violate other server-enforced
constraints (such as a uniqueness constraint on a property other than `id`).

A server **MUST** return `409 Conflict` when processing a `PATCH` request in
which the resource object's `id` do not match the server's endpoint.

A server **MUST** include error details and provide enough information to
recognize the source of the conflict.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-responses-other" id="crud-updating-responses-other" class="headerlink"></a> Other Responses

A server **MAY** respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server **MUST** include [error details] with error responses.

A server **MUST** prepare responses, and a client **MUST** interpret
responses, in accordance with

### <a href="#crud-updating-relationships" id="crud-updating-relationships" class="headerlink"></a> Updating Relationships

Although relationships can be modified along with resources (as described
above), LI:API also supports updating of relationships independently at
URLs from [relationship links][relationships].

> Note: Relationships are updated without exposing the underlying server
semantics, such as foreign keys. Furthermore, relationships can be updated
without necessarily affecting the related resources. For example, if an article
has many authors, it is possible to remove one of the authors from the article
without deleting the person itself. Similarly, if an article has many tags, it
is possible to add or remove tags. Under the hood on the server, the first
of these examples might be implemented with a foreign key, while the second
could be implemented with a join table, but the LI:API protocol would be
the same in both cases.

> Note: A server may choose to delete the underlying resource if a
relationship is deleted (as a garbage collection measure).

#### <a href="#crud-updating-to-many-relationships" id="crud-updating-to-many-relationships" class="headerlink"></a> Updating To-Many Relationships

A server **MUST** respond to `POST`, and `DELETE` requests to a
URL from a to-many [relationship link][relationships] as described below.

For all request types, the body **MUST** contain a `data` member whose value
is an empty array or an array of [resource identifier objects][resource identifier object].

If a client makes a `POST` request to a URL from a
[relationship link][relationships], the server **MUST** add the specified
members to the relationship unless they are already present. If a given `id` is already in the relationship, the server **MUST NOT** add it again.

> Note: This matches the semantics of databases that use foreign keys for
has-many relationships. Document-based storage should check the has-many
relationship before appending to avoid duplicates.

If all of the specified resources can be added to, or are already present
in, the relationship then the server **MUST** return a successful response.

> Note: This approach ensures that a request is successful if the server's
state matches the requested state, and helps avoid pointless race conditions
caused by multiple clients making the same changes to a relationship.

In the following example, the comment with ID `123` is added to the list of
comments for the article with ID `1`:

```http
POST /articles/1/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": [
    { "id": "123" }
  ]
}
```

If the client makes a `DELETE` request to a URL from a
[relationship link][relationships] the server **MUST** delete the specified
members from the relationship or return a `403 Forbidden` response. If all of
the specified resources are able to be removed from, or are already missing
from, the relationship then the server **MUST** return a successful response.

> Note: As described above for `POST` requests, this approach helps avoid
pointless race conditions between multiple clients making the same changes.

Relationship members are specified in the same way as in the `POST` request.

In the following example, comments with IDs of `12` and `13` are removed
from the list of comments for the article with ID `1`:

```http
DELETE /articles/1/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "data": [
    { "id": "12" },
    { "id": "13" }
  ]
}
```

> Note: RFC 7231 specifies that a DELETE request may include a body, but
that a server may reject the request. This spec defines the semantics of a
server, and we are defining its semantics for LI:API.

server **MUST** return a `202 Accepted` status code.

##### <a href="#crud-updating-relationship-responses-204" id="crud-updating-relationship-responses-204" class="headerlink"></a> 204 No Content

A server **MUST** return a `204 No Content` status code if an update is
successful and the representation of the resource in the request matches the
result.

> Note: This is the appropriate response to a `POST` request sent to a URL
from a to-many [relationship link][relationships] when that relationship already
exists. It is also the appropriate response to a `DELETE` request sent to a URL
from a to-many [relationship link][relationships] when that relationship does
not exist.

If a server accepts an update but also changes the targeted relationship(s)
in other ways than those specified by the request, it **MUST** return a `200
OK` response. The response document **MUST** include a representation of the
updated relationship(s).

##### <a href="#crud-updating-relationship-responses-403" id="crud-updating-relationship-responses-403" class="headerlink"></a> 403 Forbidden

## <a href="#query-parameters" id="query-parameters" class="headerlink"></a> Query Parameters

### <a href="#query-parameters-families" id="query-parameters-families" class="headerlink"></a> Query Parameter Families

Although "query parameter" is a common term in everyday web development, it is
not a well-standardized concept. Therefore, LI:API provides its own
[definition of a query parameter](#appendix-query-details).

For the most part, LI:API's definition coincides with colloquial usage, and its
details can be safely ignored. However, one important consequence of this
definition is that a URL like the following is considered to have two distinct
query parameters:

```
/?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10
```

The two parameters are named `page[offset]` and `page[limit]`; there is no
single `page` parameter.

In practice, however, parameters like `page[offset]` and `page[limit]` are
usually defined and processed together, and it's convenient to refer to them
collectively. Therefore, LI:API introduces the concept of a query parameter
family.

A "query parameter family" is the set of all query parameters whose name starts
with a "base name", followed by zero or more instances of empty square brackets
(i.e. `[]`) or square-bracketed legal [member names]. The family is referred to
by its base name.

For example, the `filter` query parameter family includes parameters named:
`filter`, `filter[x]`, `filter[]`, `filter[x][]`, `filter[][]`, `filter[x][y]`,
etc. However, `filter[_]` is not a valid parameter name in the family, because
`_` is not a valid [member name][member names].

### <a href="#query-parameters-custom" id="query-parameters-custom" class="headerlink"></a> Implementation-Specific Query Parameters

Implementations **MAY** support custom query parameters. However, the names of
these query parameters **MUST** come from a [family][query parameter family]
whose base name is a legal [member name][member names] and also contains at least
one non a-z character (i.e., outside U+0061 to U+007A).

It is **RECOMMENDED** that a capital letter (e.g. camelCasing) be used to
satisfy the above requirement.

If a server encounters a query parameter that does not follow the naming
conventions above, and the server does not know how to process it as a query
parameter from this specification, it **MUST** return `400 Bad Request`.

> Note: By forbidding the use of query parameters that contain only the characters
> \[a-z\], LI:API is reserving the ability to standardize additional query
> parameters later without conflicting with existing implementations.

## <a href="#errors" id="errors" class="headerlink"></a> Errors

### <a href="#errors-processing" id="errors-processing" class="headerlink"></a> Processing Errors

A server **MAY** choose to stop processing as soon as a problem is encountered,
or it **MAY** continue processing and encounter multiple problems. For instance,
a server might process multiple attributes and then return multiple validation
problems in a single response.

When a server encounters multiple problems for a single request, the most
generally applicable HTTP error code **SHOULD** be used in the response. For
instance, `400 Bad Request` might be appropriate for multiple 4xx errors
or `500 Internal Server Error` might be appropriate for multiple 5xx errors.

### <a href="#error-objects" id="error-objects" class="headerlink"></a> Error Objects

Error objects provide additional information about problems encountered while
performing an operation. Error objects **MUST** be returned as an array
keyed by `errors` in the top level of a LI:API document.

An error object **MAY** have the following members, and **MUST** contain at
least one of:

* `id`: a unique identifier for this particular occurrence of the problem.
* `status`: the HTTP status code applicable to this problem, expressed as a
  string value.  This **SHOULD** be provided.
* `code`: an application-specific error code, expressed as a string value.
* `title`: a short, human-readable summary of the problem that **SHOULD NOT**
  change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of
  localization.
* `detail`: a human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
  problem. Like `title`, this field's value can be localized.
* `source`: an object containing references to the primary source of the error.
  It **SHOULD** include one of the following members or be omitted:
  * `pointer`: a JSON Pointer [[RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)]
    to the value in the request document that caused the error [e.g. `"/data"`
    for a primary data object, or `"/data/title"` for a specific
    attribute]. This **MUST** point to a value in the request document that
    exists; if it doesn't, the client **SHOULD** simply ignore the pointer.
  * `parameter`: a string indicating which URI query parameter caused
    the error.
  * `header`: a string indicating the name of a single request header which
    caused the error.
* `meta`: a [meta object][meta] containing non-standard meta-information about the
  error.
